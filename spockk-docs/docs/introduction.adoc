Spockk is a testing and specification framework for Kotlin.
It is heavily inspired by the https://spockframework.org/[Spock] framework for Groovy and aims to provide a Kotlin-native version of Spock’s expressive specification syntax.
Spockk runs on the JUnit Platform, making it compatible with most build tools and IDEs.
