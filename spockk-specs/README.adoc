Specifications for the framework written with Spockk.

== Setup

It is impossible to apply the compilation plugin to the module in which it is declared.
Therefore, the specifications have to be defined in a separate module.
The `spockk.compiler-plugin-consumer` included build plugin takes care of adding the plugin-under-development to the compilation tasks.
It applies the `spockk-compiler-plugin` directly rather than via the `spockk-gradle-plugin`.
The latter would require the `spockk-gradle-plugin` to be an included build plugin, which complicates the entire project setup.
Tests mostly use the built-in assertion framework from Kotlin together with the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/power-assert.html[power-assert compiler plugin].
While the assertions are very limited at the moment, this setup will allow us to easily migrate to implicit assertions once they are implemented.
